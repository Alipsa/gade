<!-- 
gmd or Groovy Markdown is basically markdown where groovy code can used to 
create dynamic content. The process is gmd - md - html - pdf 
-->
# Test

<!-- By enclosing groovy code in scriptlet tags, it can be used to create markdown, e.g: -->
<%
def a = 3
for (i in 1..a) {
  out.println("Hello ${i}")  
}
%>

- first 
- second

<!-- some care needs to be taken when groovy code should just be rendered e.g:
variable references in text i.e. ${} must be excaped as below -->
```groovy
def q = 213
println("q is \${q}")
``` 
<!-- We can use entities -->
X = &sum;(&radic;2&pi; + &#8731;3)
<!-- and since we are in UTF-8 world, we can just write special characters directly -->
X = ∑(√2π + ∛3)
