<h2>Loading packages</h2>
<p>
Since Groovy is running in a JVM, Java classloading mechanisms apply to loading packages. This means that Groovy packages
(libraries) need to be repackaged into jar files and made available to the classloader (i.e. made part of the classpath) when
running Groovy.
<p>
    When using Gade, you have three options to make a Groovy package available to the ScriptEngine so that you can load packages:</span>
    <ol>
        <li>Publish the package to a Nexus server and use <span class="code"><span class="keyword">@Grab(</span> <span class="string">"yourpackage"</span>)</span></li>
        <li>Add the dependency to the build.gradle used in your project (you need to enable the "use build.gradle classloader" setting for this to work), no need for @Grab in this case.</li>
        <li>Copy the jar file to the Gradle lib dir (making the package part of the system classpath)</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Use @Grab</h3>
If the package you want to use is an open source library published to maven central, you can just @Grab it directly.
If the package is published to some other Nexus server, you need to tell Grape where @Grab can find it:<br/>
<code>Grape.addResolver(name:<span class="string">'myNexus'</span>, root:<span class="string">'http://nexus.somecompany.com/'</span>)</code>


<h3>Add the dependency to the build.gradle In your project</h3>
This is a simple thing to do. Let's say you need to get data from MongoDb.
You go to the <a href=https://mvnrepository.com>Maven Repository</a> search and look up mongodb.
You will see that the dependency information for gradle is
<div class="codeblock">
    implementation 'org.mongodb:mongodb-driver-sync:4.8.1'
</div>
You just need to go the dependencies' section in the projects' build.gradle and add the dependency there.<br/>
<br/>
There is a project wizard that help you create a gradle project,
but you can easily create your ow gradle project from scratch if you are familiar with Gradle. If you have enabled the Global Option
"Use build.gradle classpath", Gade will parse the build.gradle and use that classpath when running your Groovy code.
You need to be aware that the way this is done is by creating a new classloader with the Gade classloader as the parent.
This means that if a dependency is already defined in Gade this is the version that will be used regardless of what you specify in your build.gradle.
E.g. it is not possible to define another version of Groovy in your build.gradle and expect Gade to honor that version when you run your Groovy code.
However, Gade also support running gradle directly and when you do that only the dependencies of your build.gradle are honored,
so it is still possible to execute tests etc to verify that your project works without surprises
before integrating it with your application server of choice to run your code.
Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/perNyfelt/gade/wiki">
collaborative-analytics-example in the Wiki</a> for an example of a custom Groovy package,
a maven project using the package and a spring boot application using this project.

<h2 id="using_packages">Using Packages</h2>
There are millions (at the moment of writing this, 28.9 Million) of packages available on Maven Central. There is a
    package that enables or simplifies pretty much anything you want to do. There is also a lot of packages doing basically the same thing
    and the quality varies.<br />

Some of the basic packages that works flawlessly from my own personal experience are listed below.<br/>
