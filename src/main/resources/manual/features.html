<h4 id="running_code">Running code</h4>
<div>
    <p>
        Running code works more or less the same regardless if it is Groovy or SQL code.
        If you select a certain portion of text and click the Run button or ctrl+enter the selection only will
        be executed. To execute the whole script, either have no selected code or all of the code selected (ctrl+a).
        If nothing is selected, and you hit ctrl-enter, the current line will be executed.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can cancel a running process by clicking the running engine icon in the console part (lower left quadrant).
        There is also a menu option under session for the same thing.
        Note that the running of both Groovy code and Sql code can be cancelled/stopped. However, this is not the case
        for JavScripts (as the Nashorn js engine does not provide a way to do so).
        Infinite loops and long-running IO etc. can thus render the Gade application more or less unusable and might
        have to be killed externally.
    </p>
    <p>
        For SQL you first need to reference a connection (i.e. create one in the connections tab) and then pick it in the
        drop-down.
    </p>
    <div>
        If you want to execute multiple update statements you should separate them with ; even though it is possible to
        run it anyway. However, the result coming back from such a query depends on the database and driver implementation.
        E.g. for SQL server the following code
        <div class="codeblock">
            <span class="keyword">select</span> * <span class="keyword">from</span> table1<br/>
            <span class="keyword">select</span> * <span class="keyword">from</span> table2<br/>
        </div>
        Will return results from the 1:st query only! Whereas the following will return results from both queries
        (i.e. display two tabs in the Viewer):
        <div class="codeblock">
            <span class="keyword">select</span> * <span class="keyword">from</span> table1;<br/>
            <span class="keyword">select</span> * <span class="keyword">from</span> table2<br/>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

    <h5>Console Max size</h5>
    This describes how many character that are allowed in the console. After the limit is reaches no console output will
    be written.

    <h5>Style theme</h5>
    Gade comes with 3 predefined styles. Blue, Dark and Bright. The Bright Theme is more or less the Java FX default theme but
    most care has gone into making the Blue Theme a pleasant coloring theme for Groovy development.

    <h5>Add build dir to classpath</h5>
    Will also add the target/classes and target/test-classes dirs to the classpath

    <h5>Restart session after build</h5>
    Whether to restart the session after each gradle build (so new classes etc. can be picked up)

    <h5>Enable git integration</h5>
    Whether to use git integration (git commands, syntax highlighting in the file view etc.) or not.

    <h5>Run global autorun.groovy on session init</h5>
    Enable to run a file called autorun.groovy (if it exists) from the Gade install dir each time a session (re)starts.
    It is just a normal Groovy script enabling you to set up session variables, define functions, read in data files etc.
    Note that executing the script will give no output (unless there is some problem with the script) so print etc. will
    not produce anything that can be seen.

    <h5>Run project autorun.groovy on session init</h5>
    Run autorun.groovy from the project dir (working dir) each time a session (re)starts. Same as above but for the current project
    dir.

    <h5>Add imports when running Groovy snippets</h5>
    In Groovy, imports are not part of the engine session so when executing code line by line or marking an area and run it
    will be problematic due to missing imports (Classes will not be found). When checked, Gade will add the import lines to the
    code that is selected (or to the single line executed) so that the context for the classes is there. If you do not have this checked,
    then you must use fully qualified class names if you want to be able to run single lines or sections of your code.
