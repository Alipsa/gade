# Gride
## A Groovy based Data Science Integrated Development Environment

Gride started off as a fork of [Ride](/alipsa/ride) but I wanted a simpler, more integrated set-up for Groovy based Data Science work. 
Since there is no equivalent to a data.frame OOTB in Java or Groovy, I decided to use [Tablesaw](https://github.com/jtablesaw/tablesaw) 
and integrate it as much as possible to get a similar experience as in R.
